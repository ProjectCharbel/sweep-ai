# Sweep-AI

This is a Java minesweeper ai, which can play the windows 10 variant of minesweeper: minesweeperX available [**here**](http://www.minesweeper.info/downloads/MinesweeperX.html).  
Unfortunately, because the AI relies on using screenshots and having constant window border sizes, it will only work on win10 computers.
